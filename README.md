#For Task 3 of my internship, I chose to redesign a popular mobile application, Google Pay (GPay), by identifying a specific pain point and proposing an improved UI/UX solution. While GPay is widely used for quick and easy digital payments, I observed that many users struggle with tracking how much money they spend through the app. People often intend to save money, but end up spending unknowingly because GPay does not provide an in-app method to allocate or monitor their expenses. As a result, users rely on external apps or manual notes to manage their spending.

To address this issue, I introduced a new feature called “Money Allocation” directly on the home screen. This feature allows users to allocate their available balance into different categories such as Shopping, Groceries, Savings, Bills, and more. The interface clearly shows how much money is allocated in each category and how much is still available for allocation. This helps users plan their spending more consciously and maintain better financial discipline within the same app they use daily for transactions.

The redesigned UI focuses on simplicity, clarity, and accessibility. I ensured the flow is easy to understand, the colors are clean and meaningful, and the layout supports quick interactions. By integrating expense allocation within GPay, the design reduces the need for additional applications and supports users in managing their finances more effectively.
